# 2D Celestial Body Simulator
This code creates an animation that simulates the movement of five celestial bodies (the Sun and four planets) in 2D space. The Sun is stationary at the origin, while the planets are initialized with specific positions and velocities. The positions and velocities of the planets are updated at each time step using the gravitational force between the Sun and each planet. The resulting animation shows the planets orbiting the Sun.

## Requirements
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Usage
Run the script using Python 3:

## Customization
You can customize the following aspects of the simulation:
* Initial positions and velocities of the planets
* Time step of the simulation
* Mass of the Sun

## Output
The script will create a window displaying the animation of the celestial bodies. The current time is displayed in the top left corner of the window.
